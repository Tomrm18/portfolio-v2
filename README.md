# Portfolio Website

My own portfolio website created with Gatsby. 

The code was created using the [Gatsby Start Resume Template](https://github.com/anubhavsrivastava/gatsby-starter-resume) and refactored to use Functional Components, Hooks and TypeScript, as well as to render data pulled from a config file.
